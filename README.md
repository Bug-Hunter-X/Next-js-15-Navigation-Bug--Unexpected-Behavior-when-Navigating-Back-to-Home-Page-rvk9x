# Next.js 15 Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15 navigation when using both `Link` and `useRouter` for navigation.  The issue occurs when navigating from a page (e.g., About) back to the home page. The home page may not render correctly, showing stale data or not updating the UI as expected. This issue is specific to Next.js 15's new router.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Click the button to go back to the `/` page.

Observe the behavior of the home page.  It might not correctly reflect the intended content.

## Potential Causes and Solutions

The likely cause involves how Next.js 15's router handles client-side navigation and component re-rendering.  Solutions may involve ensuring proper data fetching and updating strategies, or exploring different approaches to navigation.

Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause and implement a definitive fix. This example provides a minimal reproducible scenario for reporting the issue and contributing to its resolution.
