```javascript
// pages/about.js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function About() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const handleClick = () => {
    router.replace('/'); // Use router.replace instead of router.push
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to Home</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
The issue is solved by using the `router.replace()` method instead of `router.push()` when navigating back to the home page.  The `replace` method completely replaces the current entry in the browser history, ensuring a cleaner navigation and preventing potential conflicts.  This often resolves rendering issues after navigating back to a previous page.
